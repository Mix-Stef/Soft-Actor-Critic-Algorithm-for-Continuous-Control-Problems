# Soft Actor Critic (SAC) Algorithm for Continuous Control Problems

In this repo the "Soft Actor-Critic" algorithm is implemented from scratch in order to solve the problem of continuous control for simple (low-dimensional) enviroments. *PyTorch* is used for the neural network design and training and *Gymnasium* (OpenAI Gym) for testing the algorithm with some ready-to-go enviroments. At a later stage we will try to design custom enviroments that come from the field of Process Control.
